# Contributing

- Fork it!
- Create a remote link with main repository: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:fdaciuk/crypto-zombies-frontend.git`;
- Update your local repository: `git fetch upstream`;
- Create your feature branch based on `main`: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`;

## Running

Install local modules:

```sh
yarn
```

Then, you can start the project with the following command:

```sh
yarn dev
```

When you're ready, continue with next steps:

- Assure that the code has no lint or type errors;
- If some error was displayed, execute `yarn lint:fix` to fix it;
- Add your changes: `git add .`;
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`;
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`;
- Submit a pull request for `main` branch, and summon `@fdaciuk` :D

## Tips

- Send only one feature for Pull Request;
- Send small Pull Requests;

And you're done ;)
